# DL-plagiarism-detector
Deep Learning based plagiarism detector. First I am going to build a feature extractor for images and validate the idea of finding "plagued" images based on their features. Next, I will move to an abstract level and replicate the same idea by extracting features from text using the [ULMfit](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.06146).
